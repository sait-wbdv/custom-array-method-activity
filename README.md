# Array Methods Refactor Challenge

Welcome back from reading week! In this exercise, you'll deepen your understanding of functions and prepare for learning about powerful array methods.

**Instructions:**

1. **Pair Up:** Find a partner to collaborate with on this activity.
2. **Understand the Data:** Take a look at the `arrayOfObjects` provided in `script.js`. It's a simple array of objects, each representing a book with properties like title, author, and year.
3. **Implement Custom Array Methods:** Your task is to create your OWN versions of the following array methods:

   - `forEach`
   - `filter`
   - `map`
   - `reduce`
   - `find`

   You will be building these from scratch - **do not use the built-in JavaScript array methods!**

4. **Follow the Comments:** We've provided comments in `script.js` to guide you through the implementation of each method. Pay close attention to the expected behavior and return values.
5. **Test Your Code:** Write your own test cases to ensure your custom methods work correctly with the `arrayOfObjects` data. Consider different scenarios and edge cases.
6. **Discuss and Reflect:** After you've implemented the methods, take some time to discuss the following with your partner:
   - What challenges did you encounter?
   - How did you approach solving those challenges?
   - What are the benefits of using functions in this way?
   - How do these custom methods help you understand the purpose of the built-in JavaScript array methods?

**Tips:**

- **Break It Down:** Focus on one method at a time.
- **Test Frequently:** Don't wait until the end to test your code. Test each method as you go.
- **Collaborate Effectively:** Communicate with your partner, share ideas, and help each other out.

**Learning Goals:**

- Reinforce understanding of functions and how they work.
- Gain a deeper understanding of the logic behind common array methods.
- Prepare for learning and using built-in JavaScript array methods effectively.
